We did not use a code formatting tool such as astyle. The code has been reviewed manually several times and lives up to the same standard. We did not use a named coding standard however our comments comply to apache standard and could be used in doxygen
which was skipped due to lack of time. There is a separation between our new code and the implementation of it in assignment 2 and therefore we kept the same standard for any new lines of code written in assignment 2.

The code style was never discussed in group we followed the automatic code style helper from cloud 9 and seamlessly followed eachothers style. This should probably have been a point of discussion but we are happy with the result as is.

During pull requests there was a group discussion where each pair their own code and explained, changing hard to understand parts or explaining them if no other solution was possible. This way it was made certain that every member understood the general functionality of every pull request.

The code compiles, there are no memory leaks in either our own tests or the tests written for our implementation in assignment 2. The code features comments wherever deemed necessary and according to our abilities the comments are understandable and helpful.
There are no magic numbers outside of initial cascade_limit which has to be initialized. The code features a logical and easy to understand naming convention.
